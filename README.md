# pixoo-twitch-bot

Let's you connect your Pixoo device to your Twitch channel chat and display most recent emotes used in chat on the display.

It converts emotes to Pixoo supported format so expect compression and lower framerate in gifs.

# How to use
1. Run it
2. Fill in the form with channel name, api key
3. Select your network card that is connected to the local network where the pixoo is connected also.
4. Select your pixoo device
5. You can adjust how big the buffer for emotes is. It controlls what emote will be selected to display.
   - smaller buffer will make most recent emotes more important
   - bigger buffer will be better to remember about most recent "emote spam" and will display that emote instead of the most recent once
6. Run the services and enjoy emotes on your pixoo ðŸš€
